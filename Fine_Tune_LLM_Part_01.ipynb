AC electricity is the type of electricity that is used in homes and businesses, and it is what powers devices like lights, computers, and refrigerators.

This process is known as the photovoltaic effect. -> **Step 2: Conversion to Direct Current (DC) Electricity** -> The electrical current generated by the PV cells is in the form of direct current (DC) electricity. DC electricity is the type of electricity that flows in one direction only, like the flow of water through a hose. The DC electricity is collected from each PV cell and sent through a network of metal wires on the surface of the panel. -> **Step 3: Conversion to Alternating Current (AC) Electricity and Powering Devices** -> The DC electricity is sent through an inverter, which converts the DC electricity into alternating current (AC) electricity. AC electricity is the type of electricity that is used in homes and businesses, and it is what powers devices like lights, computers, and refrigerators. The AC electricity is then sent to a breaker box, where it can be distributed to different parts of a building or even sold back to the grid through a process known as net metering. -> Done!\n"
